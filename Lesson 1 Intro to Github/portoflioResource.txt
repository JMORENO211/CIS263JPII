I actually already have a personal GitHub but I must admit its not the most up to date and also have this
innate fear to post anything on it and have potential employees look at it. You see I am a bit of a perfectionist
and want to ensure what I post is good solid code. This just does not apply to java but also my python and other coding work. 
So maybe this is something that I can work on this semester and really develop a solid GitHub portfolio as I graduate in may
next year.
